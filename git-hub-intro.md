# Github Intro

Local vs remote - local on your computer, remote is on Github

Repo (repository) - folder on Github

clone -  copy a repo from Github to your Local

git status - informational command that tells us where the files are at in the process of pushing

Three step process
- get add. - stages changes
- get commit -m 'input any text here about the change here'
- git push - transfer local to the repo on Github


Markdown
text-based language
README.md - special file on github repos that explains content of repo


Merging branches on GitHub
- Look at all the branches on the drop down menu
- Select a branch and see the code associated with that branch
- Creating a pull request
- PR shows the difference between main and other branches
- Merge pull request - takes the difference from the branch and adds it to the main (source of truth)
- Deleted the branch on GitHub

Reconciling on our Local
- Check what branch you are on
- Go back to main branch by --> git checkout main
- git pull origin + branch name
- Delete branch locally by --> git branch -d + branch name
